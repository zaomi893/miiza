# --- absorb opt-out list -----------------------------------------------------
# `nomount absorb` converts other modules' bind mounts into injections. Safe for
# a plain file bind (exec through an injection is verified working), but a hook
# framework installs its bind from NATIVE daemon code that differs between forks
# and versions, and the failure mode is SILENT AND DELAYED: dex2oat runs during
# dexopt on app install, not at boot, so a broken hook surfaces hours later as
# "modules stopped applying to new apps" and is near-impossible to attribute.
# Skipped by default. The cost is one file keeping the bind's dev/ino/mtime
# tell, which `nomount doctor` reports so it is not invisible. Delete a line to
# absorb that module once you have verified your fork.
# Migrate the pre-v1.2.1 extensionless name. COPY, never move: the outgoing
# binary is still live until the next reboot and reads the OLD name, so renaming
# here would silently drop its opt-outs for anything that runs absorb in that
# window. The new binary prefers .txt and falls back to the old name, so both
# work; the stale copy is simply ignored afterwards.
